## Why
Bitburner users want a more interactive, menu-driven way to interact with the game and their scripts. A React-powered dialog window will provide a modern, user-friendly interface for script and game management.

## What Changes
- Add a new script called `x` that opens a React dialog window in-game
- The dialog will be menu-driven, allowing users to interact with the game and its scripts
- The UI will be extensible for future features

## Impact
- Affected specs: dialog-menu-script
- Affected code: new script file (src/x.ts), possible React component(s), integration with Bitburner UI

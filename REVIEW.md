### 3. Casino/Blackjack Automation ✅ VERIFIED & HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED
**Research Result:** Found alainbryden's advanced casino script

**Community Quality Assessment:**
- **Exceptional Implementation** - Professional-grade DOM automation
- **Advanced Strategy** - Uses optimal blackjack basic strategy with dealer card analysis  
- **Save Scumming** - Automatically reloads on losses (preserves winnings)
- **Robust Error Handling** - Handles UI lag, focus stealing, modal dialogs
- **Automatic Navigation** - Travels to Aevum, navigates to casino via UI/SF4
- **Kicked-Out Detection** - Stops when banned from casino (~$10B earnings)

**Technical Implementation Highlights:**
```javascript
// Advanced blackjack strategy (not just basic 17+ rule)
if (txtPlayerCount.includes("or")) { // Player has an Ace
    if (player >= 9) return false; // Stay on Soft 19+
    if (player == 8 && dealer <= 8) return false; // Soft 18 strategy
    return true; // Hit on Soft 17-
}
// Complex dealer analysis for optimal play
if (player >= 13 && dealer <= 6) return false; // Proper basic strategy
```

**Save Scumming System:**
- Saves after every win to lock in profits
- Reloads save file on significant losses
- Kills all other scripts to speed reload cycle
- Bets maximum amount (up to $100M) with no risk

**Our Implementation Status:**
❌ **MISSING** - No casino automation currently implemented
✅ **REFERENCE AVAILABLE** - High-quality implementation found for adaptation

**Updated Recommendation for BN1.1:** 
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - This implementation is sophisticated enough to consider
- **Early Game Boost** - Could provide significant initial capital ($10B potential)
- **Risk-Free Income** - Save scumming eliminates downside risk
- **One-Time Setup** - Run until kicked out, then focus on HWGW
- **Integration Opportunity** - Adapt core logic into our task-based framework

### 4. Contract Solving Algorithms ✅ VERIFIED
**Research Source:** Multiple Reddit threads on contract solutions

**Community Insights:**
- "Proper 2-Coloring of a Graph" - Common algorithmic problem
- Stock trading contracts - Dynamic programming solutions
- Hamming codes, path finding, mathematical expressions
- Most players automate contract solving for efficiency

**Our Implementation Status:**
✅ **GOOD** - Contract solving framework exists
- contract-solve.ts and contract-scan.ts implemented
- current_algorithms.txt contains "Proper 2-Coloring of a Graph"

**Recommendation:** Expand contract algorithm library based on community solutions

# BN4 Optimal Faction & Company Progression Strategy

## 📊 Research Summary

Based on analysis of Bitburner source code augmentation data and your real-world BN4.1/BN4.2 experience, here's the optimal faction/company progression strategy for fastest BN4 completion.

## 🎯 Core Strategy: Company Factions First

**Why Company Factions Are Essential:**
1. **Faster Rep Gain** - Company work gives better rep/second than hacking work (especially in BN4 with 75% faction work nerf)
2. **Salary Income** - Helps reach $100b total earned requirement for Daedalus
3. **Critical Hacking Augmentations** - Company factions provide the best early-game hacking multipliers
4. **Better Rep/Cost Ratio** - Many company augs are cheaper than equivalent hacking faction augs

## 💰 Augmentation Purchase Strategy

- ENMDMA (1.4 hack money, 1.2 hack chance) - $7b
- ENMCoreV2 (1.3 hack money) - $4.5b
- HiveMind (3x hack grow) - $5.5b **← GAME CHANGER for botnet income**

### Priority 5: Fill to 30 Count (Buy Last)
Cheapest remaining augs + NeuroFlux Governor spam

## ⚡ Speed Run Tips

1. **Parallel Company Work**: Apply to ALL Tier 1-2 companies at once, work for highest potential rep gain
2. **Install Cycles**: Install augs every time you hit 30 count to multiply your stats
3. **Focus One Faction**: Don't spread work across multiple factions - focus 200-250k rep then move to next
4. **Company Rep Transfer**: Company rep stays after faction invite, so you can return to same company later
5. **Backdoor Early**: Backdoor company servers (ECorp, MegaCorp, etc.) to reduce faction requirement 400k → 300k
6. **City Planning**: Base in Sector-12 (Four Sigma, MegaCorp) or Aevum (ECorp, Clarke, Bachman)
7. **Skip Combat Factions**: Don't waste time on Slum Snakes, Tetrads, etc. - they don't help BN4 completion

## 📊 Expected Timeline

**With This Strategy:**
- 0-30 min: Casino → $10b, buy TOR + programs
- 30-90 min: Join early factions (CyberSec, NiteSec), apply to companies
- 2-4 hours: Company faction grinding (ECorp, Four Sigma, MegaCorp, Clarke, Bachman, NWO)
- 4-6 hours: First aug install (30+ augs), continue faction grinding with multiplied stats
- 6-8 hours: Reach Daedalus requirements (2500 hack, $100b earned, 30+ augs)
- 8-12 hours: Grind Daedalus to 2.5m rep for Red Pill  
- 12+ hours: Install Red Pill, destroy w0r1d_d43m0n, **BN4 COMPLETE**

**Result: 8-16 hour completion** (vs 20-40+ hours without company factions)

## 🎮 Automation Integration

The `auto-factions.ts` script now automatically:
1. Applies for Software jobs at all 10 company factions
2. Prioritizes company work over hacking work (better rep gain)
3. Switches to next faction when 200-250k rep reached
4. Accepts faction invites automatically
5. Works for Daedalus once joined (highest priority)

**No manual intervention needed** - just run `bn4.js` and let it work!

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these to know you're on pace:
- **2 hours**: 5+ factions joined, 10+ augs purchased, company rep multipliers active
- **4 hours**: 8+ factions joined, 20+ augs purchased, $5b+ accumulated
- **6 hours**: 10+ factions joined, 30+ augs ready to install
- **8 hours**: Daedalus joined, working on Red Pill reputation
- **12 hours**: Red Pill purchased, ready for final hack

If you're ahead of these milestones, you're doing great! If behind, focus more on company factions for faster rep gain.

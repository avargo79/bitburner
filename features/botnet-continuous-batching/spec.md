# Feature Specification: Continuous HWGW Batch Scheduling

**Feature Directory**: `features/botnet-continuous-batching/`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Create continuous batch scheduling system that launches multiple HWGW batches with precise timing so they complete in sequence for maximum throughput, eliminating the current 10-second artificial delays

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. User wants to maximize botnet income by eliminating batch spacing inefficiencies
2. System calculates optimal batch timing windows based on HWGW operation durations
3. System schedules multiple batches to complete sequentially with minimal gaps
4. System launches batches every 20-200ms instead of 10-second intervals
5. System monitors batch completion timing and adjusts scheduling dynamically
6. System achieves 10-500x throughput improvement over single-batch mode
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Bitburner player wanting to maximize income from my botnet, I want a continuous batch scheduling system that eliminates wasted time between HWGW batches. Instead of launching one batch every 10 seconds and leaving servers idle, I want the system to launch batches every 20-200ms with precise timing so each batch completes exactly when the next begins, achieving maximum throughput and dramatically higher money generation rates.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** servers have sufficient RAM for multiple batches, **When** continuous scheduling activates, **Then** system launches batches every 20-200ms instead of 10-second intervals
2. **Given** HWGW batches are running continuously, **When** batches complete, **Then** each batch finishes exactly when the next batch's operations begin
3. **Given** RAM becomes limited, **When** system detects insufficient resources, **Then** system dynamically adjusts batch count to stay within RAM constraints
4. **Given** batch timing conflicts occur, **When** system detects overlap, **Then** system automatically adjusts scheduling intervals to prevent conflicts

### Edge Cases
- What happens when available RAM drops below multi-batch threshold?
- How does system handle when batch operations take longer than expected?
- What occurs when network topology changes during continuous operation?
- How does automation adapt when new servers become available mid-operation?

# Feature Specification: Autopilot System

**Feature Directory**: `features/autopilot/`  
**Created**: Wed Sep 10 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an autonomous autopilot system that provides hands-off gameplay automation by integrating with existing navigator and guide systems. The system monitors game state changes and executes optimal progression strategies automatically, adapting to different BitNodes and game phases, particularly focusing on early game automation before Singularity APIs are available."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Autonomous gameplay automation system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Player progression, Faction management, Augmentation purchasing
   ‚Üí Actions: Monitor game state, Execute progression strategies, Automate decisions
   ‚Üí Data: Player stats, Faction availability, Augmentation costs, Game progression
   ‚Üí Constraints: Early game focus, Browser automation, RAM efficiency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All major aspects clearly defined in input description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: Complete early game progression automation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement tested for clarity and measurability
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Player state, Faction progression, Augmentation management, Automation actions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed
   ‚Üí Focus maintained on user value, not implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Bitburner player, I want an autopilot system that automatically progresses through early game content so that I can achieve optimal faction joining, reputation building, and augmentation purchasing without manual intervention, allowing me to focus on higher-level strategy or other activities while the game progresses efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new BitNode with default starting conditions, **When** autopilot is activated with balanced settings, **Then** system automatically joins CyberSec faction and begins working for reputation without user input
2. **Given** sufficient money and faction reputation, **When** optimal augmentations become available, **Then** system automatically purchases high-value augmentations based on ROI analysis
3. **Given** multiple faction opportunities available, **When** autopilot evaluates progression paths, **Then** system prioritizes faction joining based on augmentation access and progression requirements
4. **Given** active faction work in progress, **When** reputation thresholds are met for desired augmentations, **Then** system automatically stops work and initiates augmentation purchases
5. **Given** configured spending limits, **When** augmentation costs exceed budget thresholds, **Then** system maintains cash reserves and continues reputation building instead of purchasing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when faction requirements change or are not met (insufficient stats)?
- How does system handle faction conflicts (city factions, competing requirements)?
- What occurs when browser automation fails (page load errors, UI changes)?
- How does system respond when augmentation prerequisites are missing?
- What happens when multiple high-value augmentations become available simultaneously?

## Requirements

### Game Integration Requirements
- **GI-001**: System MUST integrate with Bitburner NS API through direct NS parameter usage
- **GI-002**: System MUST respect server RAM constraints and report memory usage under 10GB total
- **GI-003**: System MUST gather state dynamically from NS API calls and browser DOM scraping (no persistent storage needed)
- **GI-004**: System MUST be implemented as standalone script that can be executed via NS.run() with command-line arguments

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: System MUST execute within 8GB RAM budget per server instance
- **PR-002**: System MUST complete individual automation actions within 30 seconds to avoid blocking game performance
- **PR-003**: System MUST handle continuous operation for 4+ hours without manual intervention
- **PR-004**: System MUST scale to operate alongside existing botnet and navigator systems without conflicts

### Data Requirements
- **DR-001**: System MUST gather player statistics, faction status, and augmentation availability dynamically via NS API calls each evaluation cycle
- **DR-002**: System MUST maintain decision state consistency during 30-second evaluation intervals (in-memory only)
- **DR-003**: System MUST handle script restarts gracefully by re-evaluating game state (stateless design)
- **DR-004**: System MUST expose automation status and decisions through ns.print() output and optional status commands

### Automation Requirements
- **AR-001**: System MUST operate autonomously without user intervention for complete early game progression
- **AR-002**: System MUST adapt to changing game conditions including faction availability, stat requirements, and money fluctuations
- **AR-003**: System MUST prioritize operations based on ROI analysis and optimal progression paths
- **AR-004**: System MUST log all automation decisions and actions using ns.print() and ns.tprint() for monitoring and debugging

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically detect available factions and their joining requirements
- **FR-002**: System MUST evaluate faction joining opportunities based on augmentation access and progression value
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically join optimal factions when requirements are met
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically initiate faction work (hacking, field work, security) based on player stats and efficiency
- **FR-005**: System MUST monitor faction reputation progress and stop work when targets are achieved
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically purchase augmentations when cost/benefit thresholds are met
- **FR-007**: System MUST respect configurable spending limits and maintain emergency cash reserves
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle augmentation installation timing and coordinate with BitNode progression
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide pause/resume capability for manual intervention
- **FR-010**: System MUST offer multiple automation modes (conservative, balanced, aggressive) with different risk profiles

### Key Entities
- **Player State**: Current stats, money, faction memberships, augmentation ownership, and progression status
- **Faction Opportunity**: Available factions, joining requirements, reputation status, and augmentation rewards
- **Augmentation Investment**: Augmentation options, costs, benefits, prerequisites, and purchase timing
- **Automation Decision**: Planned actions, priority levels, resource requirements, and success criteria
- **Configuration Profile**: User preferences, spending limits, faction restrictions, and automation boundaries

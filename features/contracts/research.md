# Technical Research: Contract Solver System

**Feature**: Contract Solver System  
**Date**: Wed Sep 10 2025  
**Context**: Comprehensive automation for solving all Bitburner coding contract types

## Research Findings

### Architecture Decision: Single-File Implementation
**Decision**: Implement all contract solving functionality in a single standalone script (`src/contracts.ts`)  
**Rationale**: Contract solving requires 20+ different algorithms with no shared state between executions. Keeping everything in one file simplifies maintenance, reduces complexity, and ensures all algorithms are available without dependency management.  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Modular approach with separate algorithm files (rejected: unnecessary complexity, import overhead)
- Helper script architecture (rejected: additional RAM costs, deployment complexity)
- Dynamic algorithm loading (rejected: security limitations, performance overhead)  
**RAM impact**: ~17.4GB total (dominated by NS contract APIs: 13GB for data access, 4.4GB for solving)

### Network Discovery Strategy
**Decision**: Breadth-first network scanning with visited set tracking  
**Rationale**: Ensures complete network coverage while avoiding infinite loops. Contracts can appear on any accessible server, so comprehensive scanning is required. BFS provides optimal discovery order.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Depth-first search (rejected: potential stack overflow on large networks)
- Cached server lists (rejected: dynamic network changes, new server spawning)
- Targeted scanning based on server types (rejected: contracts appear randomly)  
**RAM impact**: ~0.4GB (scan: 0.2GB + ls: 0.2GB)

### Algorithm Implementation Approach
**Decision**: Inline implementation of all 20+ contract algorithms within single script  
**Rationale**: Each contract type requires specialized mathematical or algorithmic solution. Algorithms are deterministic and don't benefit from external optimization. Keeping them inline ensures reliability and reduces dependencies.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- External algorithm libraries (rejected: import complexity, potential version conflicts)
- AI/ML-based solving (rejected: overkill for deterministic problems, reliability concerns)
- Community algorithm sharing (rejected: security risks, inconsistent quality)  
**RAM impact**: 0GB additional (pure computation, no NS API calls)

### Error Handling and Retry Logic
**Decision**: Track failures per contract with maximum retry limit (3 attempts)  
**Rationale**: Contracts have limited attempts before expiring. Some failures may be due to temporary issues (formatting, precision) rather than algorithmic errors. Retry logic provides resilience while avoiding infinite loops.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- No retry logic (rejected: reduces success rates for temporary failures)
- Unlimited retries (rejected: wastes attempts on fundamentally broken solutions)
- Exponential backoff (rejected: unnecessary for deterministic problems)  
**RAM impact**: ~0.1GB for failure tracking maps and retry state

### Solution Verification and Debugging
**Decision**: Comprehensive verification system with detailed failure analysis  
**Rationale**: Contract failures provide limited feedback from the game. Detailed verification helps identify whether failures are due to algorithm errors, formatting issues, or precision problems. Essential for debugging and improvement.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Minimal error handling (rejected: difficult to debug failures)
- External verification tools (rejected: additional complexity)
- Manual debugging only (rejected: time-intensive, not scalable)  
**RAM impact**: 0GB (debugging logic only executes on failures)

## Algorithm Research and Implementation

### Mathematical Algorithms
**Category**: Pure mathematical computation  
**Examples**: Find Largest Prime Factor, Square Root, Prime Numbers  
**Implementation approach**: Direct mathematical computation using established algorithms  
**Key considerations**: Precision handling for large numbers, BigInt support for overflow prevention

```typescript
// Example: Efficient prime factorization
solvers['Find Largest Prime Factor'] = function (data) {
    let fac = 2
    let n = data
    while (n > (fac - 1) * (fac - 1)) {
        while (n % fac === 0) {
            n = Math.round(n / fac)
        }
        ++fac
    }
    return n === 1 ? fac - 1 : n
}
```

### Dynamic Programming Algorithms
**Category**: Optimization problems with overlapping subproblems  
**Examples**: Total Ways to Sum, Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum  
**Implementation approach**: Bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization  
**Key considerations**: Memory efficiency for large input spaces, optimal substructure identification

```typescript
// Example: Classic coin change dynamic programming
solvers['Total Ways to Sum'] = function (data) {
    const ways = [1]
    ways.length = data + 1
    ways.fill(0, 1)
    for (let i = 1; i < data; ++i) {
        for (let j = i; j <= data; ++j) {
            ways[j] += ways[j - i]
        }
    }
    return ways[data]
}
```

### Graph and Array Algorithms
**Category**: Data structure manipulation and traversal  
**Examples**: Spiralize Matrix, Array Jumping Game, Shortest Path  
**Implementation approach**: Standard algorithms adapted for specific contract constraints  
**Key considerations**: Boundary condition handling, optimal traversal strategies

```typescript
// Example: Matrix spiral traversal with boundary tracking
solvers['Spiralize Matrix'] = function (data) {
    const spiral = []
    const m = data.length
    const n = data[0].length
    let u = 0, d = m - 1, l = 0, r = n - 1, k = 0
    
    while (true) {
        // Traverse right, down, left, up with boundary updates
        // Implementation handles edge cases and termination conditions
    }
    return spiral
}
```

### String and Compression Algorithms
**Category**: Text processing and data compression  
**Examples**: Compression algorithms, string manipulation  
**Implementation approach**: Efficient string processing with optimal compression ratios  
**Key considerations**: Compression ratio optimization, decompression verification

### Algorithmic Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity**: Most algorithms O(n) to O(nÂ²), some specialized algorithms O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity**: Generally O(n) auxiliary space, optimized for memory-constrained environment  
**Performance targets**: Sub-second execution for typical contract sizes, scalable to large inputs

## Technical Implementation Decisions

### BigInt Handling for Large Numbers
**Decision**: Use BigInt for mathematical operations that may overflow standard JavaScript numbers  
**Rationale**: Some contracts involve very large numbers that exceed JavaScript's safe integer limit. BigInt ensures accuracy for all mathematical operations.  
**Implementation**: Automatic detection and conversion for applicable contract types

### JSON Serialization for Debugging
**Decision**: Custom JSON stringify function that handles BigInt and complex data structures  
**Rationale**: Standard JSON.stringify fails on BigInt values. Debugging requires reliable serialization of all data types.  
**Implementation**: Recursive serialization with type-aware conversion

### Contract State Persistence
**Decision**: In-memory state tracking only, no persistent storage  
**Rationale**: Contracts are ephemeral and disappear after solving or expiring. Persistent state adds complexity without benefit. Fresh scanning each cycle ensures accuracy.  
**Implementation**: Maps and Sets for tracking solved/failed contracts within execution session

### Performance Optimization Techniques
**Decision**: Lazy evaluation and early termination where possible  
**Rationale**: Some algorithms can terminate early when optimal solutions are found. Reduces computation time for large inputs.  
**Examples**: Prime factorization early termination, path finding with goal detection

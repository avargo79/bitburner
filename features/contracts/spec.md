## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Bitburner player wanting to maximize rewards from coding contracts, I want an automated system that discovers all contracts across the network, identifies each contract type, applies the correct solution algorithm, and tracks success rates. The system should handle all 20+ contract types, recover from failures, and provide clear statistics on rewards earned and solving efficiency.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** contracts exist on network servers, **When** solver runs, **Then** system discovers all contracts through network scanning
2. **Given** various contract types are found, **When** system analyzes contracts, **Then** system identifies correct solution algorithm for each type
3. **Given** contract solutions are executed, **When** solutions are submitted, **Then** system successfully solves contracts and earns rewards
4. **Given** some contracts fail to solve, **When** failures occur, **Then** system tracks failures and retries with different approaches

### Edge Cases
- What happens when contract data is corrupted or invalid?
- How does system handle when solution algorithms fail due to edge cases?
- What occurs when network scanning finds contracts on inaccessible servers?
- How does automation adapt when new contract types are introduced?

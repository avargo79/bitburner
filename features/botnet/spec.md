## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Bitburner player wanting to maximize income through automation, I want a comprehensive botnet system that automatically discovers servers, gains root access, purchases additional servers, and coordinates sophisticated HWGW attacks across the entire network. The system should handle all complexity of timing, thread allocation, and performance monitoring while providing clear statistics on income generation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** player has basic hacking skills, **When** botnet script runs, **Then** system automatically discovers and roots all accessible servers within skill range
2. **Given** player has sufficient funds, **When** system needs more RAM, **Then** system automatically purchases servers up to configured maximum
3. **Given** servers are available for targeting, **When** system runs HWGW batching, **Then** system coordinates precise timing across multiple servers for maximum income
4. **Given** servers fail or become unavailable, **When** errors occur, **Then** system automatically recovers and reallocates threads to working servers

### Edge Cases
- What happens when player lacks funds for server purchases?
- How does system handle when target servers become impossible to hack?
- What occurs when purchased servers reach RAM limits?
- How does automation adapt when player gains new hacking skills?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

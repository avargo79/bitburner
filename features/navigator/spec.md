# Feature Specification: Navigator Browser Automation

**Feature Directory**: `features/navigator/`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Implemented (Existing Feature)  
**Input**: Complete browser automation system for Bitburner game interface

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. User wants to automate game interactions beyond terminal commands
2. Navigator provides programmatic access to all game sections
3. Scripts can click buttons, fill forms, read data from any page
4. Automation workflows combine multiple page operations
5. System adapts to UI changes through fallback strategies
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT automation capabilities users need
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW browser APIs are accessed (stealth techniques)
- üéÆ Written for Bitburner automation stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Bitburner player running automation scripts, I want to programmatically interact with every part of the game interface so that I can create comprehensive automation workflows that go beyond just terminal commands. The system should handle clicking buttons, reading information, filling forms, and navigating between game sections reliably.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** player is on any game page, **When** automation script calls `nav.navigate(GameSection.Terminal)`, **Then** browser navigates to terminal page and returns terminal interface
2. **Given** player is on hacknet page, **When** script calls `hacknet.buyNode()`, **Then** system clicks buy button and purchases new hacknet node
3. **Given** player has augmentations available, **When** script calls `augs.installAll()`, **Then** system installs all purchased augmentations
4. **Given** player wants to join faction, **When** script calls `factions.joinFaction("CyberSec")`, **Then** system finds and clicks join button for CyberSec faction

### Edge Cases
- What happens when navigation element is not found (UI changed)?
- How does system handle when page elements are still loading?
- What occurs when button clicks fail due to insufficient resources?
- How does automation recover from stale element references?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Game Integration Requirements
- **GI-001**: System MUST integrate with existing navigator.ts script through browser automation
- **GI-002**: System MUST operate within browser DOM without requiring additional NS API RAM costs
- **GI-003**: System MUST use zero-cost browser API access to maintain RAM efficiency
- **GI-004**: System MUST be callable from any Bitburner script as imported functionality

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: System MUST execute navigation within 2GB total RAM budget
- **PR-002**: System MUST complete page navigation within 2000ms under normal conditions
- **PR-003**: System MUST handle element detection within 100ms for responsive automation
- **PR-004**: System MUST scale to interact with all game sections without performance degradation

### Data Requirements
- **DR-001**: System MUST read player stats, money, and game state dynamically from DOM elements
- **DR-002**: System MUST detect page readiness before attempting interactions
- **DR-003**: System MUST handle UI changes gracefully through fallback element detection
- **DR-004**: System MUST expose game section interfaces through consistent API patterns

### Automation Requirements
- **AR-001**: System MUST operate without manual user intervention once initiated
- **AR-002**: System MUST adapt to Bitburner UI updates through multiple element detection strategies
- **AR-003**: System MUST prioritize reliable element detection over speed
- **AR-004**: System MUST provide clear logging of navigation actions and failures

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST navigate to any major game section (Terminal, Hacknet, Augmentations, Factions, Stock Market, etc.)
- **FR-002**: System MUST click buttons, input values, and read text from game interfaces
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect when pages have loaded and elements are ready for interaction
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide specialized interfaces for each game section with relevant methods
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle failed element detection through multiple fallback strategies
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable high-level automation workflows combining multiple page operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain type safety through enum-driven element identification
- **FR-008**: System MUST monitor game state changes in real-time for responsive automation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **GameSection**: Represents major areas of the game (Terminal, Hacknet, Augmentations, etc.)
- **GamePage**: Interface providing click, input, read, wait operations for any game section
- **TerminalPage**: Specialized interface for terminal command execution and server navigation
- **HacknetPage**: Specialized interface for hacknet node management and upgrades
- **AugmentationPage**: Specialized interface for augmentation purchasing and installation
- **FactionPage**: Specialized interface for faction joining, work, and reputation management
- **Navigator**: Central controller providing navigation and page factory functionality
- **AutomationWorkflow**: High-level strategies combining multiple page operations

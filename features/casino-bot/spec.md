## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Bitburner player seeking alternative income sources, I want an automated casino system that plays blackjack optimally, handles all game interactions through browser automation, manages bankroll effectively, and provides continuous operation with comprehensive statistics tracking. The system should recover from errors and adapt to game interface changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** player accesses casino, **When** bot starts, **Then** system automatically navigates to blackjack game
2. **Given** blackjack game is loaded, **When** hands are dealt, **Then** system plays optimal basic strategy automatically
3. **Given** game completes hands, **When** results are processed, **Then** system tracks wins/losses and updates statistics
4. **Given** browser focus is lost, **When** focus recovery needed, **Then** system detects and recovers focus automatically

### Edge Cases
- What happens when casino interface changes or becomes inaccessible?
- How does system handle when browser loses focus during gameplay?
- What occurs when blackjack game experiences network delays or errors?
- How does automation adapt to different casino game variations?
